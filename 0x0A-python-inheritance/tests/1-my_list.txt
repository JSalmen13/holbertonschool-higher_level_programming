  
This is a doctest based regression suite for 2-matrix_divided.py
Each '>>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.

>>> MyList = __import__('1-my_list').MyList
>>> newList = MyList()
>>> newList.append(8)
>>> newList.append(2)
>>> newList.append(5)
>>> newList.append(1)
>>> newList.append(7)
>>> print(newList)
[8, 2, 5, 1, 7]
>>> newList.print_sorted()
[1, 2, 5, 7, 8]
